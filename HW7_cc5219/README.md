Assignment

Finish a plot by myself.

The plot is about the number of people got injured in car accidents during 10/17/16 to 10/18/16 in each borough of NYC.

The data includes the number of injured Persons/Pedestrians/Motorists.

Would be better if the data of Pedestrians and Motorists is plotted in stacked bars. And a table of the whole data might be helpful too.
