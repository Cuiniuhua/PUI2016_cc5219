##Assignment1

Follow the instruction and finish the plot

Defined function 'GetNYCData' based on the 'GetCitiBikeCSV'

##Assignment2

Asked for 2 day extension and worked with the help of Yao Wang(yw2278) and Dongjie Fan(df1676)

###For the elbow:

Use the function in ADS class.

###For the K-Mean Fig:

Use Yao's way to plot.

###For the Plot with NYC MAP:

The plots with number of clusters = 3 seems not right as there are more than 3 kinds of color.

And the plots with number of clusters = 5 are pretty different.
