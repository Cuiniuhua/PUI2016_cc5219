Assignment 1

Tried to finish the whole assignment myself but got many problems about dealing with the data so still ask Yao Wang(yw2278) for help about the fit and the first extra credit.

Some of the commands are still in the notebook which are the code written by myself but had mistakes.

Assignment 2

See here.

Teammates:Xinge Zhong(xz1809), Xinshi Zheng(xz1845), and Xianbo Gao(in Thursday class) We have the same idea and null hypothesis but use different data individually.

# FBB feedback
i am sorry but the authorea report is not very good. The write up has stylistical flaws, but the main ussues are the lack of motivation, lack of description of some steps of the data analysis, confusion on which test is being used, and lack of H0 and alpha statement at the beginning of the document (in the abstract/intro). Please see the authorea document for in-line comments
