Assignment 1 

Disribution plots/ Chi-square, Normal


Assignment 2

I worked with Xianbo Gao, Xinshi Zheng, Xinge Zhong.

We came up with the same idea and the skeleton (mainly thanks to Xinshi Zheng)


Idea: Old people tend to use bikes shorter distance than younger people do.


And used different data divided by different age range to verify our null hypothesis.

I used the data of 2015/10, calculated the age by 2015-birth year.(Here comes one question: Why the oldest age is 130?) and divided the sample into 13 groups by age. The information I used is age and trip duration. Then I calculated the mean of each group, made the plot of the distribution of mean trip duration with age. Then drew the normalization of that distribution.
