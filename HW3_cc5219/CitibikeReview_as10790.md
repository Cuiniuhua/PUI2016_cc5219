Hi, Chenxi!

Below is my peer review of your Citibike assignment.

a. You formulated the Null Hypothesis as following: The mean bike trip duration by older people (Age>45) is equal ot longer than the mean bike trip duration by yonger people (Age<45). While you formulated the Null Hypothesis correctly, I would make a couple of minor changes to the wording so it reads better: The mean duration of bike trips taken by older people (Age>45) is equal to or longer than the mean duration of bike trips taken by younger people (Age<45).

The formula for H0: mean(older) >= mean(younger) looks correct to me. However, I would rename the variable "mean" to "trip_duration" so it is a bit easier to understand: H0: trip_duration(older) >= trip_duration(younger).

You also did not declare a significance level alpha for testing your Null Hypothesis.   

There is a mistake your in your Alternative Hypothesis: Ha should be: mean(older) < mean(younger), not <=

b. The data you chose supports your research project. You also chose the approporiate variables ('tripduration' and 'Age') to answer the question. Good call on converting 'tripduration' from seconds to minutes. I see, however, that you processed 'Age' data in a way that will not allow you to test your Null Hypothesis. You divided 'Age' in ranges that do not correspond to below or above 45 years old, i.e. 30-40 and 40-50. I would also further investigate why you get ages above 100!

c. Since you are interested in determining whether or not there is a difference between two groups (older and younger riders) and given that your IV (age) is categorical, and DV (time) is continuous, I would use ANOVA to test your H0.

Good luck!
